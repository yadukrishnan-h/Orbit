# Contributing to Orbit

Thank you for your interest in Orbit!

Currently, Orbit is developed and maintained by a single developer. While the source code is public for transparency and educational purposes, **we are not accepting public Pull Requests (PRs) at this time.**

### How you can help:

If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to suggest an improvement, we highly encourage you to **open an Issue**!

1. Check the existing issues to ensure your topic hasn't already been discussed.
2. Provide as much detail as possible (screenshots, logs, and reproduction steps for bugs).

Thank you for helping make Orbit better!
